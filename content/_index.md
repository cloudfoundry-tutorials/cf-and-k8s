Cloud Foundry can run on top of Kubernetes, and Cloud Foundry can also be run on virtual machines too.

If your organisation uses both technologies, you might choose to run some workloads on Cloud Foundry, and others on Kubernetes directly.

In this guide we'll explore how Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes work together, how they relate to each other, help you decide which workloads to run on which technology, and answer the following questions:

* How are Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes **different**?
* What features do Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes **have in common**?
* How are Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes **used together**?
* In which scenarios would I use Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes?
